Doctor
To start, doctors have to set their availability for appointments.
- When setting availability:
- Option 1 means doctors can choose custom times to block out, and give a description.
- Option 2 means doctors will be available for all time slots within working hours of 9AM to 6PM, excluding a one hour lunch break from 12pm to 1pm.

- A Doctor can view his personal schedule which reflects the blocked out time slots along with their descriptions.

Patient
Next, patients can schedule appointments. 
- Scheduling Appointments:
- Available Time Slots will be shown
- Patients can choose time slot, if patients choose time slot not in the available time slots, their request will not go through.
